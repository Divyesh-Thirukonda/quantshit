# 🧹 Codebase Cleanup Summary - COMPLETED

## 🎯 **Mission: Keep Things Uncomplicated**

Successfully removed unused and overcomplicated code that was no longer needed after our SOLID principles refactoring.

---

## 🗑️ **What We Removed (738+ lines cleaned up!)**

### **🚮 Large Unused Files**
- ❌ **`adapters.py`** (276 lines) - Complex adapter system replaced by direct conversion
- ❌ **`event_driven.py`** (462 lines) - Event-driven features not part of core functionality  
- ❌ **`api.py`** (broken) - Replaced by cleaner `api/index.py`

### **🧹 Strategy Simplification**
- ❌ **Complex arbitrage strategy** (442 lines) → ✅ **Simple strategy** (212 lines)
- ❌ **Removed**: Adapter dependencies, complex typed system conversions
- ❌ **Removed**: Circular import issues, broken references
- ✅ **Kept**: Core arbitrage detection functionality

### **📦 Import Cleanup**
- ❌ **Removed**: `adapters` from `src/__init__.py`
- ❌ **Removed**: `event_driven` dependencies
- ✅ **Fixed**: All circular import issues
